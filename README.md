# Real_time_Vehicle_Detection
#The sample_images folders in mit contains sample images from our dataset and we coouldn't upload the dataset as it was too large(3gb)

#link to our dataset ---> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/enesbayturk/vehicle-and-pedestrian-detection-dataset

#We have 2 folders mit and opencv 

#mit:--
#This folder contains code to predict vehicle from images such as bus,van etc..
#This folder also contains some sample images as well for testing

#how to run:
#Navigate to the project src directory
#THen type python main.py(AS it is a flask application)

#opencv:--
